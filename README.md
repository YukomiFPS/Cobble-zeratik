## üì¶ What is the `.mrpack` File?

The `.mrpack` is a **custom modpack** file that includes:
- A list of mods
- Configuration files (`config`, `resourcepacks`, etc.)
- Custom settings for the modpack

This file is **designed to be used with modpack launchers** such as:
- [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/)
- [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/)
- [Technic Launcher](https://www.technicpack.net/)
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/)
- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/)

It is **not intended to be manually installed in the Minecraft mods folder**. The `.mrpack` file is **imported directly into one of the supported launchers** for easier installation and use.
